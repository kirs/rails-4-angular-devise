Almost clone of [angular-devise](https://github.com/karlfreeman/angular-devise), but with Rails 4.0 and Sorcery :)

An example Rails 4 app that uses a Angular.js UI for user signup, authentication, password retrieval and users list.

For now projects in build with: Rails 4.0, Angular 1.1.5, HAMLC templates and Sorcery.

If you want to see the source with plain templates (without HAMLC), checkout this commit: https://github.com/kirs/rails-4-angular-sorcery/tree/6c8ed8a6c7d02196d9fd89df2fa430a717fe3b04
